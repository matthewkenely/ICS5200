M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence Dissertation

# Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have proven highly effective in analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Their ability to learn intricate patterns and features makes them well-suited for medical applications such as brain tumor detection and classification, and numerous studies have shown their effectiveness in these tasks.

The area of identifying monozygotic (identical) twins from MRI scans using a computer vision approach, however, remains largely unexplored. The similarity of certain regions of the brain between monozygotic twins (especially in newborns) has been demonstrated in past research, though it is unclear which of these regions are susceptible to change due to non-genetic factors.

The success of vision models in other areas of medical image analysis, combined with the known similarities in brain structures between monozygotic twins, suggests a promising research direction. CNNs could be used to analyze a large dataset of twin and non-twin brain MRIs to identify consistent regions that remain similar despite non-genetic influences.
